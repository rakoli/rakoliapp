## BUSINESS LOGIC IMPLEMENTATION

### Automatic Payment Record Creation
When bonuses are earned, payment records are automatically created:
```php
// Registration bonus - called when business completes registration
$salesUser->createRegistrationBonusPayment($referredUserId);

// Transaction bonus - called when transaction thresholds are met
$salesUser->createTransactionBonusPayment($referredUserId, $week);
```

### Payment Processing Workflow
1. **Bonus Earned** â†’ Payment record created as 'pending'
2. **Admin Processing** â†’ Payment marked as 'paid' with method/reference
3. **Audit Trail** â†’ Complete history maintained
4. **Statistics Update** â†’ Real-time dashboard updates

### Payment Status Logic
- **Total Earned**: Sum of all payment records
- **Total Paid**: Sum of payments with 'paid' status
- **Outstanding Balance**: Earned minus Paid
- **Pending Payments**: Sum of 'pending' status payments

## TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Payment Flow Testing:
```php
// Test payment record creation
$salesUser = User::where('type', 'sales')->first();
$referral = $salesUser->referredUsers()->first();

// Should create pending payment record
$payment = $salesUser->createRegistrationBonusPayment($referral->id);
assert($payment->payment_status === 'pending');

// Test payment processing
$payment->markAsPaid('mobile_money', 'REF123', auth()->id());
assert($payment->payment_status === 'paid');
```

### 2. Statistics Verification:
```php
// Verify accurate calculations
$user = User::find($userId);
$totalEarned = $user->getTotalEarnings();
$totalPaid = $user->getTotalPaid();
$balance = $user->getRemainingBalance();

assert($balance === ($totalEarned - $totalPaid));
```

### 3. UI Component Testing:
